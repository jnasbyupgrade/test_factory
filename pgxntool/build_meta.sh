# Build META.json from META.in.json template
#
# WHY META.in.json EXISTS:
# META.in.json serves as a template that:
# 1. Shows all possible PGXN metadata fields (both required and optional) with comments
# 2. Can have empty placeholder fields like "key": "" or "key": [ "", "" ]
# 3. Users edit this to fill in their extension's metadata
#
# WHY WE GENERATE META.json:
# The reason we generate META.json from a template is to eliminate empty fields that
# are optional; PGXN.org gets upset about them. In the future it's possible we'll do
# more here (for example, if we added more info to the template we could use it to
# generate control files).
#
# WHY WE COMMIT META.json:
# PGXN.org requires META.json to be present in submitted distributions. We choose
# to commit it to git instead of manually adding it to distributions for simplicity
# (and since it generally only changes once for each new version).
